# Natural language processing with disaster tweets

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of implementing machine learning algorithms for natural
language processing, and caching up on the state of the art solutions.

I will create a local jupyter notebook to experiment with and implement different methods, for later
submission to the kaggle website when the notebook is readable and concise.
