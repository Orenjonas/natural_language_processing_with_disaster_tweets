## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of implementing machine learning algorithms for natural
language processing, and caching up on the state of the art solutions.

I will create a local jupyter notebook to experiment with and implement different methods, for later
submission to the kaggle website when the notebook is readable and concise.

## TODO
- Use a docker image
- Use "location" and "keyword" in analysis?
- Fine tune LSTM model
    - Inspect incorrectly classified tweets
    - Add spelling corrections
    - Play with training parameters
    - Try a different pre-trained GloVe model
    - Add estimated sentiment of tweet to the data
- Compare with a RoBERTa model
